/**
 * พักห้องเดียวกับ — the control that attaches this trip to a colleague's
 * booking, and the one that undoes it (AP-17 package E, spec §1 and §6).
 *
 * ## It REPLACES choosing an accommodation, and the parent is what enforces that
 *
 * A guest books nothing: that is the whole feature. So attaching is not a
 * field added beside ที่พักค้างคืน, it is the alternative to it —
 * `TravelBookingTab` renders this component *instead of* the accommodation
 * grid once the tab is a guest, and clears `accommodationId` in the same patch
 * that sets the flag. **Neither half is cosmetic.** Leaving the grid on screen
 * would invite a state with a room booked and a room shared, which nothing
 * downstream knows how to price; leaving a stale `accommodationId` in the tab
 * would post it on the next save and hand `deriveBookingFlags` a live answer
 * to a question the requester has withdrawn — the same failure
 * `selectVehicleBoth` clears the rent fields to avoid.
 *
 * ## The warning is the only one anybody gets
 *
 * The host does not consent (spec §2). `ROOM_SHARE_AGREEMENT_LINE` is
 * therefore shown *before* the choice, inside the picker, and again on the
 * attached card — not tucked under a "read more". See its own docblock.
 *
 * ## Two fetch surfaces, both pre-existing, neither widened
 *
 * The person search is `/api/request/travel-booking/requesters`, the HR-backed
 * roster search the on-behalf เปลี่ยนผู้ขอเบิก picker already uses, reached
 * through the very same `RequesterPickerModal`. Spec §6 names
 * `/api/users/search` instead; that route is
 * `requireRole(["IT Admin","System Admin"])`, so an ordinary requester cannot
 * call it at all and following the spec literally would 403 for almost
 * everybody. This one is `requireAuth` and answers a `staffId`, which is
 * exactly what the hosts endpoint takes.
 *
 * The request list is `room-share/{guestRequestId}/hosts`, which returns the
 * running number, the travel dates and the work location and deliberately
 * nothing else (spec §6 — not the amount, not the attachments, not the ID
 * card). `HostCandidateRow` is imported as a **type** from the service so this
 * component cannot invent a field the endpoint does not send;
 * `room-share-response-shape-guard.test.ts` pins the other end.
 *
 * ## The button saves the draft, rather than asking the requester to (2026-09-22)
 *
 * It used to be disabled on an unsaved tab, beside "กรุณาบันทึกร่างก่อนจึงจะ
 * เลือกห้องพักร่วมได้". The user asked for the choice without that step.
 *
 * **What was NOT done is the important half.** The hosts endpoint still takes
 * the caller's own request id in its path and is still authorized
 * `authorizeAccRequest(…, "mutate", AP-17)` against it — creator only,
 * `Draft`/`Returned` only, plus the UAT tester barrier. Without that gate any
 * authenticated employee could enumerate any colleague's AP-17 running
 * numbers, travel dates and work locations, and one person listing another's
 * requests is the only new authorization reach this feature added. The
 * complaint was the *friction*, not the gate, so the gate stands and the press
 * satisfies it: `onRequireSave` saves the group, hands back this tab's new
 * `AccRequest.Id`, and only then does the picker open. A refused save opens
 * nothing and says so.
